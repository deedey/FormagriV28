*** 0. PRE-Installation  ***
****************************

    Read security.txt after you complete the installation.

 1. Make sure you have PHP (www.php.net) installed.  We recommend version 3.0.12
    or higher.  Phorum has been known to work with 3.0.6, but we have also seen
    problems with this version.  Phorum 3.2.x was tested with version 4.0.3.

 2. Make sure you have one of the supported databases installed.  At the time
    this was written the ones tested by the Phorum team are:
    MySQL version 3.22.x or higher. (www.tcx.se)
    PostgreSQL 6.4.1 or higher (www.postgresql.org)

    There are also database modules for other databases.  These are not tested
    by the Phorum team.

    Sybase SQL Server
    Microsoft SQL Server

 3. If you do not have a database already, create a database.  In MySQL you
    use the "mysqladmin" program like this:

    mysqladmin -uuser -ppaswword create mydb

 4. Be sure that you have a user for that database which has the rights to
    select, insert, update, delete, create, alter and drop.  A MySQL Grant
    statment for this user would look like this:

    GRANT
      select, insert, update, create, alter, delete, drop
    ON
      database.*
    TO
      user@localhost
    IDENTIFIED BY
      'password';


************************
*** 1. Installation  ***
************************

    Read security.txt after you complete the installation.

******* There is a script in the scripts dir called install.sh.  If you are on
******* a Unix system please use this script to set up Phorum.  This script
******* make many of the following steps unnecessary.

 1. Edit common.php.

    a) Change $inf_path to the dir where you will put forums.php.  See
       security.txt for more on why you should move it.

    b) Change $include_path to the dir where you will put the included
       files.  There is no real risk in leaving these where they are.
       If you are uncomfortable about people possibly reading code on
       your server you may want to move them.  Simply changing the dir
       name to something unique would do.

    c) Change $admindir to the dir where you will put the admin files.  See
       security.txt for more on why you should move it and how to protect it.
       If you move the admin directory to somewhere other than one level down
       from the current location, see security.txt for details on how you must
       change the admin/index.php to reflect these changes.

    e) Set the name ($admin_page) of the main admin script (index.php by default).

    f) Configure Phorum to interface with your DBMS.

       This means uncommenting the line in common.php that corresponds to your
       database system.  MySQL is selected by default.  The variable that needs
       to be changed is $db_file

       NOTE FOR POSTGRESQL USERS:  If you are using PostgreSQL 6.5 or newer use
       the postgresql65.php file.  Others use the postgresql.php file.

    g) If you want to use a different base tablename that "forums" change the
       value of $pho_main to reflect this.

 2. Give write permissions to the webserver on the admin/forums dir.

     > cd admin
     > chmod 707 forums

    This is only secure if you are on a dedicated server.  If you are on a
    shared server, see security.txt for more detail on securing your files.

 3. Give write permissions to the webserver on the configuration files.

     > cd [inf_path]
     > chmod 707 forums.php
     > chmod 706 forums.bak.php

    This is only secure if you are on a dedicated server.  If you are on a
    shared server, see security.txt for more detail on securing your files.

 4. Move the files into your web tree.  Be sure you move forums.php and
    forums.php.bak to the location you designated in common.php for
    $inf_path.  By default these files are in the include dir.

    NOTE: If this is a first time install you will need to rename the following:
      forums.php-dist => forums.php
      forums.bak.php-dist => forums.bak.php
      header.php-dist => header.php
      footer.php-dist => footer.php

    In most cases, changes to your existing forums.php can be included by
    upgrading the admin files and selecting "Rebuild INF file".

 5. Secure forums.php and forums.php.bak according to your setup as laid out
    in security.txt.

 6. Goto the admin from a web browser.  This is admin/index.php by default.

 7. Now select 'Main'.  Then, select 'Change Password'.  Fill in your new
    password and hit Update.

 8. Select 'Phorum Setup' and then 'Database Settings' from the menu.  Enter the
    database information you are asked for and hit update.  The admin will still
    report that there is no database connection.  This should go away on the
    next screen.

 9. Select 'File/Path Settings'.  If you plan on changing any of the file names
    or extensions of the files do it now.  Also, the forum url should be filled
    in for you.  Do not change it unless the URL you are currently accessing the
    admin from is different from the publicly accessed Phorum installation. Hit
    update.

10. Now select 'Global Settings'.  Once there you must fill in the default
    email and select a language file.  Hit update.

    Phorum is now ready to be used.

*************************************
*** 2. Creating a forum or folder ***
*************************************

 1. Select 'New Forum' or 'New Folder'.

 2. Fill out this form completely and hit 'Update'.  If you are unsure of
    some information, consult your systems admin.

    Field                  Description
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Name                   This is the name of the Forum that user will see.  This
                           is a required field

    Description            This will appear under the forum name and will tell
                           users about the subject matter of the forum.  This is a
                           required field

    Config Suffix          This is used to allow seperate header, footer,
                           censor and bad* files.  See Other Features for more.

    Folder                 This is the folder under which this forum will be
                           listed.

    Table Name             This is the table name that will store the messages
                           for this forum.  This is a required field, and if it
                           is a new table, it must not collide with any existing
                           table names

    Table already exists   Check this if the table name already exists for this
                           forum.

    Moderation             This determines the level of moderation the forum
                           will have.

    Moderator Email        This is the email address of the forum moderator.
                           This should be given even if there is no moderation.

    Moderator Password     This must be given even if there is no moderation.
                           When filled into the email box of the post form, the
                           moderators post will be bolded and HTML will not be
                           stripped.  This is a required field.

    Mailing List Address   If you would like all forum messages to go to an
                           email address, supply it here.

    Mailing List Return    If you would like all emails sent from forum to come
                           back to a specific address, enter it here.

    Duplicate Posts        Phorum can eliminate some duplicate posts.  This does
                           require and extra couple of queries.

    Messages Per Page      This numer determines the minimum messages that are
                           shown on a page.  Phorum stops displaying messages
                           when this number is met and the last thread is
                           completely displayed.

    Thread Type            Select between multiple level nesting fo messages or
                           single level of nesting.  single is faster but can
                           be confusing.

    Thread Display         Select between collapsed threads or expanded threads.
                           Collapsed is faster.  This only sets the default.
                           Users can select how they want it viewed.

    Read Messages          Select between one message per page or all messages
                           in a thread on a page.  Again like above this is only
                           the default.

    Moderator Host         When moderators post using the moderator password
                           their IP is replaced with this value.  This gives the
                           moderator more anonymity.

    Language               Select the language for the forum.  More files can be
                           found at the Phorum web site.

    HTML                   You can allow HTML in your posts.  BE CAREFUL.  THIS
                           CAN OPEN YOUR SYSTEM UP TO CERTAIN JAVASCRIPT
                           ATTACKS.

    Table Width            This value sets the table width of all tables with
                           exception of the post table.

    Table Header Color     Color in hex value of the table headers.

    Table Header Font Color  Color in hex value of the table header font.

    Main Table Body Color  Color in hex value of the main table bodies.

    Main Table Body Font Color  Color in hex value of the main table fonts.

    Alt. Table Body Color  Color in hex value of the alt table bodies.

    Alt. Table Body Font Color  Color in hex value of the main table font.

    Navigation Background Color  Color in hex value of the navigation background

    Navigation Font Color   Color in hex value of the navigation font.

 3. Before you can see the forum in the forum list, it must be activated.
    Select 'Activate Forum/Folder' and hit 'Continue'.  The forum should now be
    active.  Select the link 'forums' at the top of the page.

Follow steps 1-3 to add more forums.

*** 3. Features      ***
************************

New Features in 3.2.x:

 1. Improved Phorummail. It is finally what it should be. Allows for proper
    message threading in email clients and avoids loops entirely.
 2. Improved install and upgrade scripts.  Unix users with access to the
    console no longer have to edit any files manually for a standard install.
 3. Added support for SYBASE and MSSQL.
 4. Added file attachment capabilities.  This is fairly basic support.  There
    are no restrictions of file size or type.
 6. Added optional multi-forum search (advsearch.php).  This file needs to be
    renamed to search.php if you want to let your users use it by default.  Either
    that or provide a link to it in the search.php page.
 7. Added plugin prototype.  Simple text-replacement plugin included.  This
    can be used for supporting things like emoticons (smilies) in messages,
    text shortcuts, etc.
 8. Added recent-admin code in the admin section.  No longer have to search for
    recent posts.

New Features in 3.1.x:

 1. New and improved admin.  Moderators do not have access to other forums or
    to main settings.  The UI is much improved.  More options on forums.  Admin
    code is more modular allowing easier modifications.  Options like the
    database server and language setting is a readable text value not a file
    name.

 2. The introduction of Folders.  Now not only can you have multiple forums, you
    can have folders that contain forums.  These can also contain more folders,
    and so on.  With version 3.1, folders can have separate config files such as
    unique headers/footers, etc...

 3. All messages in a thread can be viewed on one page. (flat mode)

 4. Forum URL's are shorter.

 5. Added latest reply date in collapsed mode.

 6. New search features allow for conditional searching, date ranges, and
    limiting the fields that are searched.

 7. New moderation features.  Now messages can be held until approved.  All
    messages will be mailed to the moderator for approval.  Simple urls will be
    provided in the email for the mdoerator to approve, delete, or edit the
    message.

 8. There can now be seperate bad* files and censor files for each forum.  See
    Other Features, #1 for instruction on creating these.

Other Features:

 1. Multiple forums on one engine.  You can create different header, footer,
    censor, and bad* files for different forums.  Simply fill in 'Config Suffix'
    when creating your forums with a string and then create files named
    header_suffix.inc where suffix is the string you gave the admin when
    creating the forum.

 2. Database independence.  Phorum currently supports MySQL and PostgreSQL.
    To support your databse, convert abstract.php to work with your db.  To
    change the db engine used by Phorum refer to step 1.2 above.

 3. Multi-leveled threading.  This is enabled by default, but can be set off if
    desired on a forum by forum basis.  Select the forum you want to enable it
    for, then select 'Edit Properties'.  Change Thread Type from Multiple Levels
    to Single Level

 4. Emailing readers when replies are posted to a thread.

 5. Limited HTML/URL linking.  The following text decoration tags are allowed
    in all posts: <b>,<u>,<i>,<ul>,<ol>,<li>.  Plus any URL surrounded by <>
    will be linked.  Full HTML use is allowed and can be enabled in the admin
    on a forum by forum basis.  Select the forum you want to enable it for,
    then select 'Edit Properties'.  Check the box under 'allow HTML' and hit
    'Update'.

 6. Take Phorum up and down from the admin.  This is great for maintenence.
    Select 'Down Phorum' from the main menu, enter the master password and hit
    'Login'.  All requests to the Phorum will now be sent to down.php.  To
    bring Phorum back up, select 'Up Phorum' from the main menu, enter the
    master password and hit 'Login'.

 7. Moderator Privileges.  When the master password or the forums moderator
    password is entered in place of the email address, the message is given
    moderator priveleges.  This includes: the message will be bolded in the
    message list; the host/ip will be replaced with the string specified by
    the moderator under 'when moderator post, replace host with' in the admin
    section for that forum. The post will also be given full HTML privileges.

 8. index, list, read, post, down, and violation file names as well as the
    extension are defined as variables.  This can be changed in the
    'Master Settings' section of the admin.
    NOTE: THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE FILE NAMES.  YOU MUST DO THIS MANUALLY.

 9. User Banning.  You can ban users by email, name, or their IP/HOST.  See
    bad_*.inc for details of use.  These can be created for each forum.  See
    number 1 for details.

10. Allows for censored posting.  There are instructions in censor.php as to how
    to use it.  By default the f word and sh-t are censored for example.

11. Allows for disallowing service to a given author, email or domain.
    Entries in bad_names.inc, bad_hosts.inc and bad_emails.inc will be
    checked for when a message is posted.  If any are present, the user will
    be forwarded to violation.php.  There are instructions in those files
    as to how to use them.

12. Localized text (Multi-lingual).  Additional language files are available at
    http://www.phorum.org/local.php

13. Ability to quote text from original message.  This is not available if
    viewing the messages in "Flat View".

14. Colors, table sizes configurable in Admin

15. Control number of messages displayed in main list.

16. Edit a post or delete entire threads or individual messages.

17. Search Engine (needs improvement)

18. Collapsible threads.  This can be defaulted on or off in the forum admin
    section.
